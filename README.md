# Project Proposal

### Project title
WHORYOU 

### What?
This software will comprise of fun personality tests/quizzes that use MBIT personality types(Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, MBTI).
 
People will choose tests. Sample test titles could include
   "Which Animal does your personality match you?"
   "What Plant you are"
   "Finding your perfect present for Christmas"
   "How would I react to fraud"
   "Finding your color"
   "Best pet for you"
They will answer psychological or random questions.
Answers will be analyzed and people will get to read fun quiz results.
Then they could also share it with friends and others through SNS.
 
### Why?
The biggest feature of this program provides will be entertainment. Various theme quizzes could entertain people. Also, since the results will be created out of data analysis, people could even find results that they could agree on.
Moreover, due to the pandemic situations, our socializing styles have changed. People prefer remote meetings and a lot of our life goes on in the online world. So, it got harder to understand "Who you are" from human relationships. Through light quizzes, people could not only reflect back upon their personalities but also get to know others through sharing with friends.
 
### For whom?
This is for everyone!

### How?
This will be developed in subsequent work but I think it will implement API, HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery programming, and database.

### Scope
4- 6 programmers to undertake in one semester. Not only this project will require programming, but we would also need to do some research on MBTI/ or other personality types, create questionnaires, and write fun outputs with cute visualization effects.
